# Burger-Game

This game was developed in Unity by Zac Hays. Some models were created using the free Blender modeling software.

The objective of the game is to cook and assemble hamburgers. It features the ability to cook patties, slice and dice ingredients, and assemble burgers in a physics-enabled environment.
